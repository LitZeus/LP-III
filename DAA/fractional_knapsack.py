    """
    Fractional Knapsack Problem:
    The goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack with a fixed capacity.
    Unlike the 0/1 knapsack problem, items can be divided, allowing for fractional amounts.

    Greedy Approach:
    1. Calculate value-to-weight ratio (r_i = v_i / w_i) for each item.
    2. Sort items in descending order based on their ratio.
    3. Iterate through the sorted items:
       - If an item can fit entirely, take it.
       - If not, take the fraction that fits.
    4. Continue until the knapsack is full or all items have been considered.

    Example:
    Items: [(Weight, Value)]
    - (10, 60), (20, 100), (30, 120)
    Capacity: 50
    - Total Value: 240.00 (Take full Item 1 and Item 2, and 2/3 of Item 3)

    How the Code Uses the Greedy Approach:
    - It calculates the value-to-weight ratio for each item to prioritize items with higher value per weight.
    - Items are sorted based on this ratio.
    - The algorithm selects items greedily, taking full items when possible and fractions of items when the knapsack is near capacity.

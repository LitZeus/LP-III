    """
    0-1 Knapsack Problem:
    The goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack with a fixed capacity.
    Each item can either be taken in full or left behind; partial items cannot be taken.

    Dynamic Programming Approach:
    1. Create a 2D table (dp) where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained
       with the first i items and a maximum weight w.
    2. Initialize the table such that dp[0][w] = 0 for all w (no items means no value).
    3. Iterate through each item and each capacity:
       - If the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity, consider including it.
       - Otherwise, retain the value from the previous item.
    4. The solution to the problem is found in the bottom-right cell of the table (dp[n][W]).

    Example:
    Items: [(Weight, Value)]
    - (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)
    Capacity: 5
    - Total Value: 7.00 (Take Item 1 and Item 2)

    How the Code Implements the Dynamic Programming Approach:
    - It initializes a 2D array to store maximum values.
    - The nested loops fill this array based on whether each item can fit within the capacity.
    - The maximum achievable value for the full set of items and the given capacity is extracted from the table.
